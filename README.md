Also, there is a hugh opportunity in the development of the Women Market, for example primary and preventive care, fertility support, and pregnancy, postpartum, and parenthood  For example, according to Rock Health Organization, they said that forecasts indicate miles of innovation runway ahead for women+ digital health projects that the global market for womenâ€™s health will reach $60 billion in 2027, compared to its $18.75 billion valuation in 2019.  The digital health ecosystem is changing at lightning speed, and while funding for nearly all areas within digital health has increased since the start of the pandemic, digital health founders and investors have yet to realize the full potential in designing equitable and comprehensive care offerings that serve women+.
